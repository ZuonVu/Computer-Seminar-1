This Happy Birds game is the combination of 2 of my favourite games Flappy Bird and
Angry Birds. While Flappy Bird inspires the game mechanics of tapping to fly the bird
against gravity, Angry Birds gave me the idea of using pig collisions for points.
To be specific, under gravity, Happy Bird requires the players to carefully control a
bird that not only can jump vertically using the left click but also move horizontally by
pressing the A and D keys. In addition, points can be earned when the bird collide with
the green pigs. The best score will be recorded, and a notice will be shown when the
player surpasses the old best score. If the bird collides with the boundaries, logs, ground,
or the enemy birds (the original Flappy Bird), the game will end. Lastly, to pause the
game, the player can use the right click.
